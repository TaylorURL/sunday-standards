"""Drives the SEO rules into a project's own files, so every one of them lands rather than being reported.

This is a build checklist, not an audit. A gate that is not met is markup to write,
a file to add, or a template to change; the only ways past one are making that
change or naming the condition that puts the gate out of scope. A gate the sweep
failed cannot be recorded as passing, and a gate marked fixed reopens if the next
sweep still fails it. The report at the end records what changed.

Most SEO tooling reads a live URL and scores it. A score is a survey: it names what
is wrong and leaves the work undone, and the next crawl finds the same list. So
every check here reads the project's own source instead - templates, components,
head metadata, robots.txt, sitemaps, structured data - because that is the only
place a finding can actually be fixed.

    start     open a run and print the gates it must satisfy
    scan      re-derive what the project contains, and therefore which gates apply
    verify    run every automated check and record its verdict
    resolve   answer a gate: pass, fixed, or n/a, with the evidence
              --batch <path|-> answers many at once, a status and a note each
    status    what is still outstanding; --full adds each gate's rule and fix
    report    render the filled checklist
    finish    close the run - refuses while anything is unanswered
    gates     print the registry, whole or filtered
    pages     the routes the run found, and the head metadata each one carries
    files     the file ledger: what is still to be read and ruled on
    file-clear  rule a file as needing no SEO change, with the reason

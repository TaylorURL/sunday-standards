## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/logo/search.py` | Search styles, colors, industries; generate design briefs |
| `scripts/logo/generate.py` | Generate logos with Gemini Nano Banana |
| `scripts/logo/core.py` | BM25 search engine for logo data |

## Commands

### Design Brief (Start Here)

```bash
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/search.py "tech startup modern" --design-brief -p "BrandName"
```

### Search Domains

```bash
# Styles
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/search.py "minimalist clean" --domain style

# Color palettes
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/search.py "tech professional" --domain color

# Industry guidelines
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/search.py "healthcare medical" --domain industry
```

### Generate Logo

Generate against white, deliver with alpha. White gives the model a clean field to draw a
mark on; a white box behind the mark on every surface that is not white is a broken
deliverable. `scripts/logo/transparent.py` floods the background in from the border, so
white inside the mark — a counter, a knockout, a highlight — survives. Generation runs it
automatically; run it by hand on anything that arrived another way.

```bash
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/generate.py --brand "TechFlow" --style minimalist --industry tech
python3 ~/.sunday/profile/skills/design-checklist/scripts/logo/generate.py --prompt "coffee shop vintage badge" --style vintage
```

Options: `--style`, `--industry`, `--prompt`

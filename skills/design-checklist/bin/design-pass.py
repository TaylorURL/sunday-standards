"""Drives the design skill's rules into the work, so every one of them lands rather than being browsed.

This is a build checklist, not an audit. A gate that is not met is work to do; the
only ways past one are changing the code or naming the condition that makes it
inapplicable. A gate the sweep failed cannot be recorded as passing, and a gate
marked fixed reopens if the next sweep still fails it. The report at the end is a
record of what changed, not a survey of what was found.


The design skill knows a great deal - the slop test, the polish checklist, the UX
guideline set, the brand and asset rules. Left as prose it gets read the way prose
gets read: the model picks what looks relevant and the rest goes unchecked. Nothing
about that is visible afterwards, because an unchecked item and a passing one look
identical in the output.

So the checklist is data, the applicable subset is computed rather than chosen, and
the run cannot close with an item left silent. Gates that a regex can settle are
settled here; the rest are answered by the model with its evidence recorded beside
them. A check that cannot reach a verdict says so and still needs the answer - an
unimplemented check must never read as a pass.

    start     open a run and print the gates it must satisfy
    scan      re-derive what the target contains, and therefore which gates apply
    verify    run every automated check and record its verdict
    resolve   answer a gate: pass, fixed, or n/a, with the evidence
              --batch <path|-> answers many at once, a status and a note each
    status    what is still outstanding; --full adds each gate's rule and fix
    report    render the filled checklist for the user
    finish    close the run - refuses while anything is unanswered
    gates     print the registry, whole or filtered
    files     the file ledger: what is still to be read and ruled on
    file-clear  rule a file as needing no design change, with the reason
                --batch <path|-> clears many at once, a reason each
    skeleton-probe  record a browser capture of the loading and loaded states
    cohesion  compare every file against the others for design mismatches
    spacing-probe  record a rendered capture of the space between things
    layout-probe   record a rendered capture of headline wrap, fold, and bar height
    mobile-probe   record a phone capture of reach, menu fit, rail clearance, and taps
    read      record the design read: page kind, audience, vibe, constraints
    scopes    the named scopes a run can be narrowed to

    guard-stop   Stop hook: refuse to end a session with a run still open
    guard-land   PreToolUse hook: refuse `git commit` / `gh pr create` mid-run
    guard-skill  PreToolUse hook: point a design invocation at this checklist
    hook-skill   PostToolUse hook: open a run when the design skill is invoked
    hook-edit    PostToolUse hook: open a run when a design surface is edited
    hook-read    PostToolUse hook: credit a file in the ledger once it is read
Answers already given are carried into a later run when neither the gate, this
tool, nor any file in scope has moved since, so a repeat run works only what
actually changed. --fresh on start or verify re-asks everything, and
SUNDAY_PASS_NO_CACHE=1 turns it off everywhere. Answers that reach past
the project are never carried.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- scopes

# A run answers for the whole deliverable by default, and PRC-08 exists to stop
# that being narrowed quietly. A scope is the other thing: a narrowing said out
# loud. It is recorded on the run, every report leads with it and with what it
# did not look at, and finish repeats it, so a scoped pass can never be read as a
# full one. What it changes is which gates are asked, never how hard any of them
# is to answer.

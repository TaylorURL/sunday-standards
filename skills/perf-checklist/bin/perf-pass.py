"""Drives loading and responsiveness fixes into a project's own files, and proves the page still looks the same.

Every rule here changes how bytes reach the browser, never what those bytes
describe. A route is split, an image is offered at more widths, an animation is
expressed as a transform: the reader sees the page they saw before, sooner. That
invariant is the reason this checklist can run unattended, and it is the easiest
one to break by accident, so it is measured rather than promised - the rendered
page is captured before the work and again after, and any element that moved,
any computed style that changed, any route that stopped rendering holds the run
open.

The other half is that a score is not a diagnosis. A lab run is a simulation on
one throttled connection and is dominated by loading, so a site whose real
visitors are waiting on interaction can be optimised for a week without the
rating moving. The run reads the field record first and names the metric that is
actually failing.

    start     open a run and print the gates it must satisfy
    scan      re-derive what the project contains, and therefore which gates apply
    verify    run every automated check and record its verdict
    resolve   answer a gate: pass, fixed, n/a, or disputed, with the evidence

    status    what is still outstanding; --full adds each gate's rule and fix
    report    render the filled checklist, with the before and after numbers
    finish    close the run - refuses while anything is unanswered
    gates     print the registry, whole or filtered
    routes    the routes the run found, and what each one costs
    files     the file ledger: what is still to be read and ruled on

"""Reads a project's database and the code that is supposed to use it, and writes
what it found as one JSON file for db-pass.py to answer gates from.

The pairing is the whole point. A schema read on its own says a table exists; a
repository read on its own says a name is absent. Only the two together say a
table is standing that nothing reads, which is the finding this checklist exists
to produce, and it is the one that never shows up in either half alone.

Credentials are read at the point of use and never written to the output: the
Supabase access token comes from SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN, and every value that
looks like a key is scrubbed from anything quoted back.

    probe.py all --root <path> --project-ref <ref> --out /tmp/db-probe.json

--project-ref may be omitted when the repository names one, in which case the
first ref found in a .env, a config file or a committed URL is used, and the
output records which file it came from so a wrong guess is visible rather than
silent.

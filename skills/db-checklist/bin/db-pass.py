"""Drives the database and the code that uses it into agreement, gate by gate.

This is a build checklist, not an audit. A gate that is not met is a table to
drop, a policy to write, a job to unschedule, or a prune to install; the only
ways past one are making that change or naming the condition that puts the gate
out of scope. A gate the probe failed cannot be recorded as passing, and a gate
marked fixed reopens if the next probe still fails it.

It asks one question and leaves the neighbouring ones alone: does the database
match what the code actually does. Whether a service answers at all belongs to
the stack checklist, how long a page takes to the performance checklist. A
finding that belongs to one of those is delegated by name and carried in the
report, never resolved here and never dropped.

Two things separate it from its siblings. Its subject is not in the repository,
so every gate that matters answers to a query against the live catalogue and
refuses an attestation - a table created by hand is invisible to any number of
migration files read carefully. And one of its verbs destroys data, so PRC-04
holds the run open until a run that dropped anything says where the rows went.

"""Checklist run pointers whose session ended, and the guards they still block.

The six checklist engines each claim a run by writing a pointer at
`<state>/<kind>-runs/current-<session>.json`. A session that ends without
closing its run leaves the pointer behind, and nothing has ever removed one. The
Stop guard reads whatever pointer it resolves, so an abandoned run from last
week refuses a session this week over gates nobody in it opened: forty-five of
them had accumulated over seven days, and four separate design runs were
refusing turns across three sessions apiece.

Age alone is not the reading. A run somebody is working is rewritten on every
answer, so the file's own clock says whether anybody is still in it, and a
pointer to a run that no longer has a record is a pointer to nothing whatever
its clock says. Both of those are conclusive. What answers to neither is
reported and left alone, because a wrong prune costs somebody an open run and a
missed one costs a refusal in a session that never opened it.

  checklist-runs.py report            every pointer, and the verdict on it
  checklist-runs.py prune             remove the ones judged abandoned
  checklist-runs.py prune --dry-run   name them and remove nothing
  checklist-runs.py install           wire the session-start prune

  --hours N   how long a run has to have been quiet to read as abandoned (12)
  --kind K    one engine rather than all six

report exits non-zero while anything is judged abandoned, so a run that ignores
it is not a run that answered it.

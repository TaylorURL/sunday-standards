"""Keep a repo's README version badge equal to the version its manifest declares.

The badge is written by hand and the version is bumped by a release, so the two drift
apart silently — a README claiming 5.2.72 while package.json says 5.2.73 is wrong in
exactly the way nobody notices until they quote it. Drift is the normal state of an
unchecked badge, and it never announces itself.

Repair, not refusal. The correct value is never in doubt, so there is nothing to ask
and nothing to block: `guard` rewrites the badge as a commit is about to land and says
what it changed. `check` reports without writing, for a caller that wants the answer
rather than the fix.

Only the version badge is touched. A badge whose label is not `version-` is left alone,
and a repo with no recognisable manifest or no version badge is a no-op rather than an
error, so this is safe to run over every repo unconditionally.

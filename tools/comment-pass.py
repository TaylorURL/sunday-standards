"""Tracks which files have had a comment pass, keyed on their content.

The writing-comments skill only helps if it actually runs. Relying on a rule in
INTELLIGENCE.md means it runs when the model remembers, which is not the same as every
time. This records the pass per file, keyed by content, so the landing skills
ask the ledger what is outstanding instead of recalling it.

Keying on content hash rather than a timestamp is what makes the "once, then only
changes" behavior fall out on its own: a file whose recorded hash still matches
its working-tree content has already been through the pass and stays out of the
way. An empty state means nothing has been swept, so every code file is
outstanding, which is the initial full-codebase sweep.

    list    paths still needing a pass, one per line (feed this to the skill)
    status  the same thing as a human-readable summary
    mark    record a pass for the given paths, or for everything outstanding

Scoped to repos under the owner's accounts, matching git-develop-base-guard.sh.
A cloned third-party repo is not part of this workflow and is left alone.

"""Shared behavior for the tools in this directory.

Every tool here runs as a standalone script: hooks and skills invoke one by
path from whatever directory the session sits in, so nothing arrives through
sys.path. A tool that needs this module loads it with importlib.util from its
own directory, falling back to the installed tree when it runs from a copy
that travelled without its siblings:

    path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "_lib.py"

What lives here is contract several tools must answer identically: where
per-machine state lives, what counts as an owned repository, how a per-repo
ledger file is read and written, which shell commands land work and in which
directory, how a session transcript reads back, and how a file two tools both
write is replaced and held. A tool holding a divergent variant of any of these
keeps its own copy -- this module carries only the behavior that must not
drift between callers.

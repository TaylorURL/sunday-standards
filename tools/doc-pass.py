"""Tracks which Markdown files have been checked against the code they describe.

The sibling of comment-pass.py, for prose instead of comments. Same verbs, same
state layout. What differs is what "unchanged" has to mean.

A comment sits in the file it describes, so that file's content hash answers the
whole question. A README does not: it makes claims about the repo around it, and
goes stale when the repo moves underneath it while the README itself sits still.
Keying a README on its own bytes alone would mean a new npm script or a new
top-level directory never reopens the page that documents them.

So a README is keyed on its own content plus a fingerprint of exactly what the
accuracy check reads: the script names in the manifest, and the shape of the
tracked tree. Change either and the page is outstanding again. Every other
Markdown file is keyed on its own content, because that is all it answers for.

The version badge is deliberately normalized out before hashing. It is derived
from the manifest and rewritten by the version bump on every PR, so leaving it
in would reopen every README on every release for a re-read that has nothing to
find.

    list    paths still needing a pass, one per line (feed this to the skill)
    status  the same thing as a human-readable summary
    mark    record a pass for the given paths, or for everything outstanding

Scoped to repos under the owner's accounts, matching comment-pass.py.
